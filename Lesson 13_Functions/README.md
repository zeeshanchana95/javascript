# Functions:

- methods are really built-in functions. 
Example: <code>"Zeeshan".toLowerCase(); Math.random();</code>

- when we are defining functions actually when we declare functions, we are making our own reusable code blocks

- using functions, our code becomes more efficient, and we can call that function (reusable block of code) again and again as many times we want inside our program

- function needs to be called to produce result.

- Note: <code>
    2 + undefined = NaN
</code>

- functions **provide reusable code**

- functions can be **parameterized, parameterless**

- functions can written functions as **named functions, anonymous functions, and arrow functions.**
