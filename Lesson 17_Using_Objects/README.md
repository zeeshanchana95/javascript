# Using Objects in JavaScript:

- Object used to store data in key-value pairs

- can be written by <code>const objName = {key: value}</code> form

- we can store values of different data types in objects

- we can also use functions inside objects but then those functions are called methods. In this case, function name will be key and function implementation will be value of object.

- we can refere to other information inside method defined in object using *this* keyword like <code>this.beverages.morning</code> where *this* referes to the current object. So, instead of writing object name, we simply use this keyword

- we can extract all keys and values from the objects using methods like *Object.keys(object)* and *Object.values(object)*

- we can create other objects by using base object (Inheritance)

- we can destructure object values from the actual object
