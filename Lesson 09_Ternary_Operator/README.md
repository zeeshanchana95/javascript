# Ternary Operator in JavaScript

- It is a three part rule for making decisions in javascript

- It is kind of like if-else statement where initially condition is checked, if true, if block of code executed otherwise else block of code is executed

- Syntax: **condition ? ifTrue : ifFalse** where ? is like if statement and : is like else statement

- Ternary operators will save lines of codes compared to bulky code of if-else, switch statements

- Most simple ternary operators require one line of code
